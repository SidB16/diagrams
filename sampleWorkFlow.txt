Installed pip3 and used it for the lifetime of this proj.

sudo apt-get install graphviz

sudo pip3 install diagrams

sudo pip3 install pipenv

pipenv install diagrams (this will read PIP.lock file and build dependicies?)

pipenv shell 

resource:https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/getting-started/examples
https://python-poetry.org/docs/ (ALTERNATIVE method to pipenv: oetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.)

vim diagram.py:
from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB

with Diagram("Web Service", show=False):
    ELB("lb") >> EC2("web") >> RDS("userdb")

It will be saved as web_service.png on your working directory. :)
